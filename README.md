# Snake Game in MIPS Assembly

A classic **Snake** implementation written in **MIPS assembly** for the **MARS** simulator.  
This repository is an educational project that demonstrates low-level programming concepts such as **memory-mapped I/O (MMIO)** or **bitmap graphics**.

---

## Features
- Menu navigation and keyboard-driven UI.  
- Snake movement via **W / A / S / D** or arrow keys.  
- Real-time graphics using MARS **Bitmap Display**.  
- Implemented entirely in **MIPS assembly** (no external libraries).

---

## Requirements
- [MARS MIPS Simulator](http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/) (recommended).

---

## Usage

1. Open `snake.asm` in **MARS**.

2. Load the **MMIO Keyboard and Display** tool in MARS.

3. Load and configure the **Bitmap Display** tool.

4. Assemble the program and run it.

5. Use the menu to start a game and control the snake.

**Notes**
- If the Bitmap Display resolution or unit size is wrong, the graphics will appear distortedâ€”use the configuration shown in the GIFs.  
- Adjust game difficulty by changing the timing constants in the source (see the top of `snake.asm`).

## About

This project is purely educational. I built it to better understand the MIPS architecture and to practice writing software in assembly. I plan to study additional assembly architectures in the future.
